"""
An arcade game player wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and track their 
ranking. The game uses Dense Ranking, so its leaderboard works like this:

â€¢ The player with the highest score is ranked number  on the leaderboard.
â€¢ Players who have equal scores receive the same ranking number, and the 
    next player(s) receive the immediately following ranking number.
